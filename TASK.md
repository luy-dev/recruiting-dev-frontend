## Task
Your task is to refactor the to-do application so it's actually maintainable and follows common development
practices. Take a look at the code and fix all the things you don't like. Feel free to challenge anything and don't
hesitate to come up with your own ideas!

Please think out loud and share your thought process. It's very important!

Your entry point is the `todo-list` component. Analyze what's wrong with it and think how you could refactor it.
The to-do list has the following functions:

* Listing existing to-do items.
* Filtering existing to-do items by keywords. Any word in an item's title or description can match.
* Adding new to-do items.
* Removing to-do items.

These functions should work the same as before refactoring.

When working on the task, please share your thoughts, reasoning and ask questions if something is not clear. Good luck!
